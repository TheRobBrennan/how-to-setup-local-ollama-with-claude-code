# Claude Cowork Generated Presentations

This folder contains presentations generated by Claude Cowork for the repository.

## Experiment Details

- **Date**: 2026-02-07
- **Tool**: Claude Cowork
- **Purpose**: Explore automated presentation generation for repository documentation

## Generation Prompt

The following prompt was used in Claude Cowork to generate these presentations:

```md
I want you to create several Powerpoint presentations for me - which should be 
available in my ~/Downloads folder.

These presentations should share a common theme of looking at Claude Code at a 
high-level. Then take a look at my repo at ~/repos/how-to-setup-local-ollama-with-claude-code 
and create separate presentations geared toward the following audiences:

* A high-level look for the non tech-savvy user or stakeholder as to what my 
  repo does, why it's a great starting point, and incorporate a few pricing 
  models/next steps for me to get them and/or their organization up and running 

* A technical overview for new engineers looking at considering how to 
  incorporate Claude Code without having the expensive costs of using Anthropic 
  models like Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5, and the newly announced Opus 4.6

* A technical overview for experienced/seasoned engineers wanting to explore and 
  noodle on possible ways of incorporating local models with Claude Code
```
