## Purpose

These artifacts document the experiment of using Claude Cowork to automatically generate presentation materials for the repository. They serve as reference material for:

- Evaluating the quality of AI-generated presentations
- Understanding the Claude Cowork workflow and capabilities
- Comparing the generated content against the original prompt requirements
- Future iterations and improvements to the presentation generation process
